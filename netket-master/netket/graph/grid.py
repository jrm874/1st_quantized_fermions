        Constructs a new `Grid` given its length vector.

        Args:
            length: Side length of the Grid. It must be a list with integer components >= 1.
            pbc: If `True`, the grid will have periodic boundary conditions (PBC);
                if `False`, the grid will have open boundary conditions (OBC).
                This parameter can also be a list of booleans with same length as
                the parameter `length`, in which case each dimension will have
                PBC/OBC depending on the corresponding entry of `pbc`.
