    "# Using JAX as a backend in NetKet - Feature Preview for v3.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will show how differentiable functions (for example deep networks) written in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) can be used as variational quantum states in NetKet. \n",
    "\n",
    "This feature will be available in the upcoming major release (version 3.0). While version 3.0 is still in beta development, users can already try this feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites \n",
    "\n",
    "To try out integration with JAX, you first need to fetch the development version of NetKet (v3.0) \n",
    "We recommend using a virtual environment (either a python environment or a conda environment), for example\n",

    "source nk_env/bin/activate\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/netket/netket@v3.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Frameworks such as JAX and Pytorch are add-ons for NetKet 3.0, thus they require separate installation. In this case, we can easily get JAX doing \n",

    "## Defining the quantum system \n",
    "\n",
    "NetKet allows for full flexibility in defining quantum systems, for example when tackling a ground-state search problem. While there are a few pre-defined hamiltonians, it is relatively straightforward to implement new quantum operators/ Hamiltonians. \n",

    "In the following, we consider the case of a transverse-field Ising model defined on a graph with random edges. \n",

    "We now want to define a suitable JAX wave function to be used as a wave function ansatz. To simplify the discusssion, we consider here a simple single-layer fully connected network with complex weights and a $tanh$ activation function. These are easy to define in JAX, using for example a model built with [STAX](https://github.com/google/jax/tree/master/jax/experimental). The only requirement is that these networks take as  inputs JAX arrays of shape ```(batch_size,n)```, where batch_size is an arbitrary ```batch size``` and ```n``` is the number of quantum degrees of freedom (for example, the number of spins, in the previous example). Notice that regardless of the dimensionality of the problem, the last dimension is always flattened into a single index.  \n"
